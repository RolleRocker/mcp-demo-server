## Project Overview
This appears to be a new or empty project. When assisting with development:
- Begin by clarifying project type, language, and framework requirements
- Follow the development workflow outlined below
- Keep changes minimal and focused on user requirements

## Development Workflow
1. **Project Setup**
   - Clarify project requirements before starting
   - Use project root (`.`) as working directory
   - Follow standard project structure for chosen framework/language

2. **Development Guidelines**
   - Create only necessary files and folders
   - Skip any steps not relevant to current task
   - Install only extensions specified by project setup tools
   - Keep dependencies minimal and essential

3. **Task Workflow**
   - Verify requirements before starting
   - Implement changes incrementally
   - Run diagnostics after changes
   - Update documentation as needed

## Project Structure
The project structure should follow the conventions of the chosen framework/language. Create only directories that serve a clear purpose.

## Build and Run
- Configure tasks based on project type
- Use VS Code's built-in debugging features
- Check for build errors before launching

## Documentation
- Keep README.md updated with project information
- Document only implemented patterns and practices
- Focus on project-specific approaches

Before implementing any feature:
1. Verify project requirements
2. Check existing implementations
3. Use appropriate tooling for the task
4. Test changes before completion
